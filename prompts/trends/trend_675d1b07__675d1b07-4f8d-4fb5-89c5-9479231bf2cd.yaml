  зернистость, естественное освещение от экрана.
scene_prompt: 'A hand-drawn cartoon illustration showing two stylized human characters
  standing back-to-back in a bedroom interior. The left character is a female-presenting
  cartoon figure standing slightly forward, turned three-quarters to the left, holding
  a smartphone up at arm’s length as if taking a mirror selfie. She has long straight
  brown hair that falls past her shoulders, parted slightly off-center. Her face is
  rounded with large simplified eyes; one eye is closed in a wink, the other open,
  and her lips are puckered as if blowing a kiss. She is wearing an oversized short-sleeve
  sports jersey in red with vertical blue stripes, loose gray pants, and socks. The
  phone is rectangular, dark gray, with visible rear camera lenses. Her arm is bent
  naturally, wrist angled inward toward the mirror.


  Behind her, touching back-to-back, is a male-presenting cartoon figure facing the
  opposite direction, turned three-quarters to the right. He has short black hair
  with a rounded, slightly tousled silhouette. His facial expression is neutral, eyes
  looking off to the side, not toward the viewer. He is holding a smartphone low in
  one hand near his hip, screen facing inward. He is wearing a loose blue sports jersey
  and light blue jeans with a relaxed fit, and socks. Their backs are in contact,
  forming a mirrored, opposing pose.


  The environment is a simple bedroom drawn with minimal line detail. A large bed
  with a tall headboard is positioned behind them, covered in white bedding with visible
  folds and creases. Pillows are loosely arranged. To the left side of the scene is
  a tall mirror with a thin frame, angled slightly toward the characters, implied
  by perspective lines. Behind the bed, faint vertical lines suggest curtains or drapes.
  The background is mostly white with light gray linework, minimal shading, and no
  detailed textures.


  At the top of the illustration, centered slightly left, is the text “Love is…” in
  a serif-style font, black, with a small red heart above the word “is.” At the bottom
  of the illustration is a caption in two languages: first in Cyrillic script, then
  in English, reading “…sharing your best sides with each other.” The text is centered
  and rendered in a clean, readable font. The characters occupy the central vertical
  area of the image, with generous white space around them.'
subject_prompt: ''
negative_prompt: профессиональное освещение, студийный свет
negative_scene: Photorealism, realistic textures, detailed facial features, different
  pose or orientation, different clothing colors or patterns, additional characters,
  background clutter, dramatic lighting, shadows, perspective changes, altered text
  content or placement, missing phones, incorrect body proportions.
style_preset: 'Flat, hand-drawn cartoon illustration with clean black outlines and
  soft, minimal shading. Colors are muted but clear: red and blue clothing contrasts
  against a predominantly white background. Skin tones are light peach with subtle
  blush on the cheeks. Lighting is even and diffuse with no visible light source,
  shadows, or highlights beyond simple color fills. No realistic depth of field; all
  elements are in equal focus. Perspective is slightly elevated, looking down at the
  characters at a mild angle, but mostly frontal. Line weight is consistent, giving
  a clean comic-strip aesthetic. The image is sharp with no grain or noise, resembling
  a digital illustration rather than a photograph.'
